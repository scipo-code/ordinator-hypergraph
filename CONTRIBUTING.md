### TODOs 

Handle 
- [x] Implement the `basic_start_date`
- [x] Implement the bidirectional `incidence` list
- [x] Implement `Technician`/`Worker` aggregate

Take a break now!
- [x] Test `add_activity_assignment`
- [x] Ensure every `technician` `availability` overlap with `assignment`

- [x] Ensure activity `number_of_people` bound


- [ ] Add node separator in hyperedge
- [ ] Ensure that the `skill` of the `activity` matches the `technician`
- [ ] Add exclusion checker to the system
- [ ] Apply constant size vecs
- [ ] Make `ScheduleGraphBuilder`
- [ ] Make `Parameters` `impl` block


- [ ] Why are `roles` used?
```rust

pub struct HyperEdge { 
    // Most edges have 3-5 nodes, avoid heap allocation
    nodes: SmallVec<[u64; 4]>,  // Stack-allocated for ≤4 nodes
    roles: HashMap<Role, u64>,
}
```


### Performance
- [ ] Test `std::sync::RwLock` and `parking_lot::RwLock`
- [ ] Test `SmallVec`, `Vec<u64>` vs `Vec<EnumType>`


### Goal of the Library
This crate will implement a hypergraph to work with the
ordinator scheduling application

What do you want to build now? I think that making functions to retrieve the
`Parameters` is a good idea! Yes I think that is the next goal here! Extracting
all the state from the `SchedulingEnvironment` is not a good idea. The best
thing to do is build the graph from the aggregates in the repos and then
have the algorithms only work on the Graph and then make sages 

# DESIGN DECISION: DEMARCATING NODES
This is a crucial point in the code, for every hyperedge you have to understand what the
best approach is for making the code work correctly when there is a
variable number of nodes of a specific type in the hyperedge.

1. Use a `usize::MAX` as a seperator
2. Put a struct into each `HyperEdge` enum variant.
3. Edge metadata

# DESIGN DECISION: UPDATING OF HYPEREDGES
I strongly feel that it should be illigal to mutate hyperedges. You would
have to make an enormous amount of conditionals to check the validity of the
object---meaning hyperedge.

Because you would have to check every possible partial configuration of the
objective that could occur from a mutating operation. This is not a good idea...

At the very least you would need to make it extremely clear which methods that
are mutating and which are not. You would have to make a standard interface for
handling these kind of things.

The goal here is to find the quickest possible way for integrating the hypergraph into
the `ordinator-monorepo` repository. The best approach here is to make the system
able to derive the `Parameters`

Logic stays that

```
Actors -> Hypergraph -> SchedulingEnvironment
````


That means that the Actor and therefore the parameters have to
extract information from the API of the Hypergraph. That is potentially
not very handy. Builders actually decouple the system quite nicely. 



That is the best approach I think there is also the issue of making the
system work
